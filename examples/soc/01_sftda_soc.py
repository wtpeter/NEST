# 1. High-spin scalar reference.  Both ROKS and UKS references are supported:
#
#     mf = mol.ROKS(xc="SVWN").run()
#     mf = mol.UKS(xc="SVWN").run()
#
# This example uses UKS.
mf = mol.UKS(xc="SVWN").run()

# 2. Spin-flip-down excited states.  Both SF-TDA and SF-TDDFT are supported:
#
#     td = mf.SFTDA()
#     td = mf.SFTDDFT()
#
# The XC response can use either collinear="col" or multicollinear="mcol".
# This example uses multicollinear SF-TDA.
# SOC currently supports extype=1 only.
td = mf.SFTDA().set(
    extype=1,
    nstates=3,
    collinear="mcol",
    collinear_samples=50,
).run()

# 3. Build and diagonalize the SOC Hamiltonian.
#
# The PySCF-style entry point below is recommended.  run() calls kernel() and
# returns the SOC driver itself, with the numerical results stored as
# attributes.
soc_driver = td.SOC(soctype="SOMF").run()
#
# Equivalent explicit construction:
#
#     from nest.soc import SFTDASOC
#     soc_driver = SFTDASOC(td, soctype="SOMF").run()
#
# Empty construction is also supported.  The TD object and all options are read
# when run()/kernel() starts, so attributes can be changed before calculation:
#
#     soc_driver = SFTDASOC()
#     soc_driver.tdobj = td
#     soc_driver.soctype = "SOMF"
#     e, v = soc_driver.kernel()
#
# The same setup can be written with the StreamObject interface:
#
#     soc_driver = SFTDASOC().run(tdobj=td, soctype="SOMF")
#
# The first argument is the converged SF-TDA/SF-TDDFT object ``td``, not the
# SCF object ``mf``.  Available soctype values are:
#
#   "SOMF"           one-electron SOC plus the two-electron SOMF contribution
#   "Zeff"           one-electron SOC with ORCA-style effective nuclear charges
#   "1e"             bare one-electron nuclear SOC
#   "X2CAMF"         X2CAMF SOC; requires the socutils package

# 4. Print scalar states, SOC blocks, SOCCs, SOC energies, and compositions.
# verbose=4 enables the detailed block matrices and eigenstate compositions.
soc_driver.analyze(verbose=4)

# The numerical results remain available for further processing:
# soc_driver.states        spin-free input states
# soc_driver.state_slices  mapping from spin-free states to Hamiltonian slices
# soc_driver.h_soc         complex Hermitian SOC Hamiltonian, in Hartree
# soc_driver.e, .v         SOC eigenvalues and eigenvectors
